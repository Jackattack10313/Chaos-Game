# Chaos Game
Super quick and dirty python script that I whipped up in ~30 min that performs the chaos game. I originally read about concept from *Chaos: Making a New Science* by James Gleick. I finally got around to implementing it. I used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game to help me in developing my algorithm. Points are plotted on a matplot graph. I recommend not going above 100000 points so it does not lag out.

**Dependencies:**
- matplotlib

How to download dependencies:
1. Open up cmd
2. Enter:
      - python -m pip install -U pip
      - python -m pip install -U matplotlib

How to run:
1. Navigate to where you have .py files installed (using cd & path)
2. Enter: py -3 ChaosGame.py
